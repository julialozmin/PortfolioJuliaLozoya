              I am passionate about marketing and business operations and I have
              a background in Business Administration and Advertising. I love
              challenges and learning new things, so during the pandemic I
              decided to give coding a try. I had created some websites using
              templates in the past, but I often couldn't make some changes
              because the HTML file was really intimidating. So when I saw an
              introductory course online during the lockdown, I decided to join.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
              I found it really interesting and inspiring; with some HTML, CSS
              and Javascript I made so much progress and saw great potential.
              However, life was resumed, and I set coding aside until 2023, when
              I decided to change the direction of my career and study to become
              a full-time developer.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
              Coding has been not just logical but surprisingly creative, as
              there can be different solutions to the same issue or task. I find
              it inspiring; it leads me down rabbit holes of perfectionism and,
              of course, moments of frustration.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
              I am detail-oriented, driven and flexible and, although I am
              autonomous, I thrive as a team player. A natural problem-solver, I
              enjoy thinking outside the box to find new options and improve
              workflows.

              When I am not at the computer, learning Italian or exploring new
              subjects in Udemy or Domestika, you will find me indulging in my
              favourite “granny hobbies”- sewing my own clothes, knitting or
              painting. I often multitask these activities with listening to my
              favourite podcasts (with various topics such as news, art, pop
              culture or crimes) or talking with family and friends over the
              phone, especially important to me as an expat with loved ones far
              away.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
              I have a passion for hiking and I am very fortunate because
              Abruzzo, the region I am living in, is famous for its nature, with
              multiple National Parks and Reserves, which I love to explore
              during the weekends.
